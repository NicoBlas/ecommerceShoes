Hi, this is a React proyect, made following a JPEG design aviable in https://www.frontendmentor.io/home
See the proyect on the web: https://ecommerce-shoes-im775mksa-nicoblas.vercel.app/

Brief
The challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

-View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
-Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
-Add items to the cart
-View the cart and remove items from it
